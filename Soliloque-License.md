# Soliloque License as of 2022-06-06

“raconteuria-by-claritism” contains technologies that aims to achieve:

1. Universal Equality
2. Enlightened Industrial Evolution
3. Priority Earth.

As far as the founder of “raconteuria—a FOQNE”, James C. Lin, is concerned, the projects are open source for the purpose of getting humanity's involvement to voice their needs and contribute to the codes and designs. Also, for the other purpose of public audits, so there are no hidden malware with ill intentions. There exists no effective mechanism to stop anyone from copyright infringement if any is placed on the projects originated here. Other projects will automatically inherit the license from the projects we forked from out of respect for the original creators, with the addition of this very Soliloque License you are reading now.

However, as the original intention is to be universal for all living beings, we welcome anyone's input and suggestions as long as they do not attempt to divert the direction of the projects from their original goals. Anyone or any group who forks or outright clones the projects for their purposes elsewhere will not be deterred by any form of legal actions. They have James C. Lin's full blessing and best wishes. However, this act implies that they have goals other than what these projects originally intended for. 

"Soliloque—Blueprint For The Technological Singularity", also by James C. Lin, is the foundation technology that created the theories and paradigm shifts in “raconteuria-by-claritism”. Soliloque is proprietary technology solely owned by James C. Lin and deRaconteur. It will soon be manifested in the form of a 3D operating system that interacts with users while downloading and recording their thought patterns and acts as a digital companion. When it works with its database of historical human information, namely, the “augmentation of human intellect”, as originally envisioned by Douglas C. Engelbart, the combination achieves a unique version of functional Artificial General Intelligence. This project expects to achieve alpha status within 6 months of needed funding.

We cannot verify, nor will we spend the effort to confirm their true intentions. Anyone who forks the projects listed on “raconteuria-by-claritism” on GitHub.com will be automatically disqualified for inclusion in the “augmentation of human intellect”, even if the parties involved qualify through their citizenship of origins.
