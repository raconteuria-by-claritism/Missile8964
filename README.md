##### raconteuria Launches Global Collaboration To Decentralize Hardware Manufacturing For All

Missile8964 is a public domain collaboration to design Single-Board-Computers housed in casings conforming to Open-Connection-Architecture and made with 3D-Printers using local materials and assembly. (25)

OCA defines the dimensions, coordinates, and connector types only so casings can be designed for different purposes, yet all components are interchangeable for on-the-fly reconfiguration.(24)

By standardizing the motherboard size for electronic components, worldwide dispersion of the surface-mounting process is now possible with a minimally staffed local SMT lab setup. (25)

The complete scalable modularization of components allows a plethora of computing and electronic configurations to be instantly available for most civilian and military applications.(24)

James C. Lin, the founder of “raconteuria” and author of Claritism, said : “Humanity can finally level the playing field and empower every earthling. Life can be fair, humanity didn't try hard enough.”(25)

The starter files for Missile8964 are currently available online and will be provided as public domain knowledge when finalized by 2022-04-30 at the following URL (25):
https://github.com/raconteuria-by-claritism/

raconteuria is inviting talents in Industrial Design, Graphic Design, Electrical Engineering and camera, screen and electric-motor makers worldwide to pitch in and audit the result. (25)

Nikola Tesla once said : 
“A new world must be born, a world that would justify the sacrifices offered by humanity. This new world must be a world in which there shall be no exploitation of the weak by the strong, of the good by the evil; where there will be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich; where the products of intellect, science, and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life, and not the individuals for achieving wealth. This new world shall not be a world of the downtrodden and humiliated, but of free men and free nations, equal in dignity and respect.”

##### Notes to Editors

— Visit : https://claritism.org for the list of products and industries affected by Missile8964 and other applications of OCA. 

— “raconteuria-By-Claritism” is a goodwill offering to the world in exchange for recognizing the independence of “raconteuria” – the 1st FOQNE, as a sovereign nation, which declared independence on 2021-09-01. 

— Author Neal Stephenson defined FOQNE – “Franchise Organized Quasi-National Entity” in his sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”. 
— “raconteuria” is not capitalized for a reason. Visit : https://raconteuria.org for details about it as a FOQNE. 

— The three ultimate goals of raconteuria's constitution “Claritism: Remove Humanity To Rebuild It and Repair Earth” 
	— Universal Equality 
	— Enlightened Industrial Revolution 
	— Priority Earth

Please note that Missile8964 is licensed under both APGL and "Soliloque License" as stated below.

## Soliloque License

“raconteuria-by-Claritism” contains technologies that aims to achieve:

			1. Universal Equality
			2. Enlightened Industrial Evolution
			3. Priority Earth.

As far as the founder of “raconteuria—a FOQNE”, James C. Lin, is concerned, the projects are open source for the purpose of getting humanity's involvement to voice their needs and contribute to the codes and designs. Also, for the other purpose of public audits, so there are no hidden malware with ill intentions. There exists no effective mechanism to stop anyone from copyright infringement if any is placed on the projects originated here. Other projects will automatically inherit the license from the projects we forked from out of respect for the original creators, with the addition of this very Soliloque License you are reading now.

However, as the original intention is to be universal for all living beings, we welcome anyone's input and suggestions as long as they do not attempt to divert the direction of the projects from their original goals. Anyone or any group who forks or outright clones the projects for their purposes elsewhere will not be deterred by any form of legal actions. They have James C. Lin's full blessing and best wishes. However, this act implies that they have goals other than what these projects originally intended for.

“Soliloque—Blueprint For The Technological Singularity”, also by James C. Lin, is the foundation technology that created the theories and paradigm shifts in “raconteuria-by-Claritism”. Soliloque is proprietary technology solely owned by James C. Lin and deRaconteur. It will soon be manifested in the form of a 3D operating system that interacts with users while downloading and recording their thought patterns and acts as a digital companion. When it works with its database of historical human information, namely, the “augmentation of human intellect”, similiar to the definition originally envisioned by Douglas C. Engelbart, the combination achieves a unique version of functional Artificial General Intelligence. This project expects to achieve alpha status within 6 months of needed funding.

We cannot verify, nor will we spend the effort to confirm their true intentions. Anyone who forks the projects listed on “raconteuria-by-Claritism” on GitHub.com will be automatically disqualified for inclusion in the “augmentation of human intellect”, even if the parties involved qualify through their citizenship of origins.
