##### raconteuria Launches Global Collaboration To Decentralize Hardware Manufacturing For All

##### Intro
Missile8964 is a public domain collaboration to design Single-Board-Computers housed in casings conforming to Open-Connection-Architecture and made with 3D-Printers using local materials and assembly. (25)

OCA defines the dimensions, coordinates, and connector types only so casings can be designed for different purposes, yet all components are interchangeable for on-the-fly reconfiguration.(24)

By standardizing the motherboard size for electronic components, worldwide dispersion of the surface-mounting process is now possible with a minimally staffed local SMT lab setup. (25)

The complete scalable modularization of components allows a plethora of computing and electronic configurations to be instantly available for most civilian and military applications.(24)

James C. Lin, the founder of “raconteuria” and author of Claritism, said : “Humanity can finally level the playing field and empower every earthling. Life can be fair, humanity didn't try hard enough.”(25)

The starter files for Missile8964 are currently available online and will be provided as public domain knowledge when finalized by 2022-04-30 at the following URL (25):
https://github.com/raconteuria-by-claritism/

raconteuria is inviting talents in Industrial Design, Graphic Design, Electrical Engineering and camera, screen and electric-motor makers worldwide to pitch in and audit the result. (25)

Nikola Tesla once said : 
“A new world must be born, a world that would justify the sacrifices offered by humanity. This new world must be a world in which there shall be no exploitation of the weak by the strong, of the good by the evil; where there will be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich; where the products of intellect, science, and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life, and not the individuals for achieving wealth. This new world shall not be a world of the downtrodden and humiliated, but of free men and free nations, equal in dignity and respect.”
